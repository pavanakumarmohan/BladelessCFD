# This is an example input file to generate unstrucutred grid for a cylinder. 
# To make things simple at the same time facilitate easy understading of inputs
# by the user, shell script type comments can be used in the input files. The string
# parser just ignores the comment lines and reads only the values. So make sure 
# you follow the same order for the inputs shown here and do not skip any input 
# parameters --- all inputs shown are mandatory ----
# if the program is compiled with the -DTECPLOT_BINARY_OUTPUT the user will be given a
# tecplot binary file for the grid otherwise only an ASCII file will be printed out which 
# could be very large and combusome to read for large grid size -- use with caution
